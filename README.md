# cyel (working title)
Cyel is a relatively simple HTML5 canvas based game inspired by puzzle fighter and various puzzle fighter-like games.
NOTE: As impractical as it may be, this project is being built mostly from scratch. That is all.

## Running the project locally
The project will eventually be running on a hosted website. In the meantime, run a local http server in the cyel/ directory and access cyel.html through the localhost.

Example Method (via Mac Terminal):
1. Install the http-server package following the directions at  https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server.

2. Run http-server in the cyel/ directory
```
Computer-Name:~/Documents/cyel$ http-server
```

3. Using a web browser, go to http://localhost:8080/cyel.html.
NOTE: The default port used by http-server is 8080.
