# cyel (working title)
Cyel is a relatively simple HTML5 canvas based game inspired by puzzle fighter and various puzzle fighter-like games.

## Running the project locally
The project will eventually be running on a hosted website. In the meantime, simply open cyel/app/cyel.html.

DISCLAIMER: This project is still at a very early stage and does not resemble the desired finished product. In its current state, the project only demonstrates the appearance of a game piece and certain actions it can perform.
