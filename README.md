# cyel (working title)
NOTE: As impractical as it may be, this project is being built mostly from scratch. That is all.

## Running the project locally
NOTE: The project will soon run on hosted website
Simply run a local http server in the cyel/ directory and access cyel.html through the localhost.

Example Method:
1. Install the http-server package following the directions at  https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server.

2. Run http-server in the cyel/ directory
```
Computer-Name:~/Documents/cyel$ http-server
```

3. Using a web browser, go to **localhost:8080/cyel.html**.
NOTE: The default port used by http-server is 8080.
